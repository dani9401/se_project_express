# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the backend project for the WTWR app, aka se_project_react. We have have created controllers and routes to make it possible on the backend to create new clothing items, delete clothing items, and see an entire collection of existing clothing items. Additionally, individual clothing items can be "liked" and "disliked".
We've also made it possible to create new users and find existing users by their ID.
All of this is connected and stored to a database.

## Tools and Technologies Used

This backend part of the application currently Javascript, React, MongoDB, and Postman.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Plans for Improvement

It'd be great to add additional clarity in server responses so the user is especially clear on what the probilem is and what their next steps are.
